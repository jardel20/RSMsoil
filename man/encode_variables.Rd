\title{Encode Variables to Coded Scale}
\usage{
encode_variables(data, factor_names, levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables to encode.}

\item{factor_names}{Character vector with names of factors to encode.}

\item{levels}{A list with named numeric vectors. Each element should contain
the low, center, and high levels for each factor. If NULL, levels are
automatically detected from data (min, mean, max).}
}
\value{
A tibble with encoded variables (coded scale) added as new columns
with suffix "_coded".
}
\description{
Transforms variables from their natural scale to a coded scale (-1, 0, +1) or
(-1.68, 0, +1.68) for rotatable designs. This is essential for response surface
methodology as it standardizes the experimental space.
}
\details{
The encoding formula is:

\deqn{X_i = \frac{x_i - x_{center}}{(x_{high} - x_{low}) / 2}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{x_i} is the natural value
\item \eqn{x_{center}} is the center point
\item \eqn{x_{high}} and \eqn{x_{low}} are the high and low levels
}
}
\examples{
data <- tibble::tibble(
  P = c(18, 108, 180, 252, 342),
  S = c(6, 36, 60, 84, 114)
)

# Automatic level detection
encoded <- encode_variables(data, factor_names = c("P", "S"))

# Manual level specification
levels_list <- list(
  P = c(low = 18, center = 180, high = 342),
  S = c(low = 6, center = 60, high = 114)
)
encoded <- encode_variables(data, factor_names = c("P", "S"), levels = levels_list)
